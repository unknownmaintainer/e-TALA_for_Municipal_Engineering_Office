## The Big Idea

![From Prompting to Loop Engineering](assets/illustrations/readme/01-big-idea-transformation.svg)

For two years, the way you worked with AI coding agents was simple: you typed a prompt, read the response, typed another prompt. One turn at a time. You were the human in the loop.

**Loop engineering changes that.** Instead of typing prompts yourself, you design the system that generates them — automatically, on a schedule, with verification, state memory, and sub-agent checking.

> "My job is to write loops."
> — Boris Cherny, head of Claude Code at Anthropic

> "You shouldn't be prompting coding agents anymore. You should be designing loops that prompt your agents."
> — Peter Steinberger (6.5M views)

> "Build the loop. But build it like someone who intends to stay the engineer, not just the person who presses go."
> — Addy Osmani, who coined the term

---

## What is Loop Engineering?

**Loop engineering is replacing yourself as the person who prompts an AI coding agent — designing the system that does it instead.**

    A[You Prompt] -->|Old Way| B[Agent Responds]
    B --> A
    C[System Prompts] -->|New Way| D[Agent Acts]
    D --> E[Verifier Checks]
    E -->|Pass| F[Done]
    E -->|Fail| C
```

| | Prompt Engineering | Loop Engineering |
|--|-------------------|------------------|
| **You do** | Type every prompt | Design the system |
| **Agent does** | Responds to you | Finds work, does it, verifies it |
| **Memory** | Conversation context | External state files |
| **Schedule** | Manual | Automatic (cron, events) |
| **Cost** | Per interaction | Per run (budgetable) |

The term was coined by [Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/blog/loop-engineering/) on June 8, 2026. The technique originated with [Geoffrey Huntley's](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) "Ralph" loop in July 2025.

## The Maturity Model

![Loop Engineering Maturity Model](assets/illustrations/readme/02-maturity-model.svg)

```
L1: Report Only          L2: Assisted            L3: Unattended
──────────────          ────────────            ──────────────
Reads & writes          Proposes changes        Commits & deploys
Human decides           Human merges            Autonomous
Low risk                Medium risk             High risk
Most loops stay here    After L1 proven         Few tasks earn this
```

| Tier | What It Does | When to Advance |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **L1** | Report only — changes nothing | Stay here long |
| **L2** | Proposes changes — human merges | After 1+ week L1 |
| **L3** | Autonomous — commits/merges | After 2+ weeks L2 |

## The Six Building Blocks

![The Six Building Blocks of Loop Engineering](assets/illustrations/readme/03-six-building-blocks.svg)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Automations] --> L[Loop]
    B[Worktrees] --> L
    C[Skills] --> L
    D[Plugins] --> L
    E[Sub-Agents] --> L
    F[Memory] --> L
    L --> O[Output]
    O --> F
```

| Block | What It Does | Skip If |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Automations** | Schedule/trigger the loop | You want manual runs only |
| **Worktrees** | Isolate parallel agents | Single loop only |
| **Skills** | Project conventions | Agent can figure it out |
| **Plugins** | External tools | File-only operations |
| **Sub-agents** | Independent verification | L1 with human review |
| **Memory** | Persistent state | Single-run task |

---

## Real-World Results

We ran a multi-sub-agent loop on this repo itself:

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Link Check | 145/149 valid — 4 broken links found and fixed |
| Structure Audit | 41/41 required files present |
| Content Completeness | 8/11 modules fully complete |
| Glossary Consistency | 6 terms need standardization |

**Cost:** ~$0.20 for the full 4-sub-agent audit. See [examples/code-quality-guardian/](examples/code-quality-guardian/).

---

## Pre-Flight Checklist

Before any L2+ loop:

- [ ] Verifier sub-agent or objective success criteria
- [ ] Spend cap set (daily + per-run)
- [ ] Kill switch tested
- [ ] Scope narrow enough for current tier
- [ ] Human review point defined
- [ ] Automated verification (tests, linting)
- [ ] L1 running for 1+ week
- [ ] Failure modes documented
- [ ] Rollback plan exists

---

## The Skeptics' Case

The strongest objection: **"It's just a `while` loop with an LLM call."**

Fair. The control-loop shape is decades old. What's arguably new is the scaffolding — native scheduling, worktrees, sub-agents, and memory — shipping simultaneously inside coding agent tools.

**The honest answer:** the shape isn't new; the integration is. Whether that warrants a new term is opinion. Whether the pattern works is not.

See [Module 08](modules/08-the-skeptics-case/README.md) for the full argument.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is loop engineering just a while loop?

Partially. The shape is decades old. What's new is the scaffolding that shipped inside Claude Code and Codex: native scheduling, worktrees, sub-agents, and cross-session memory. See [Module 08](modules/08-the-skeptics-case/README.md).

### How much do loops cost?

| Pattern | Monthly Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| Daily Triage (L1) | $1.50–$6.00 |
| Changelog Drafter (L1) | $1.50–$4.50 |
| PR Babysitter (L1) | $15–$60 |
| CI Sweeper (L2) | $30–$150 |

### Can a loop damage my codebase?

L1 loops cannot — they only write reports. L2 proposes changes you review. L3 is autonomous but requires proven guardrails. See [Module 07](modules/07-what-goes-wrong/README.md).

### Which coding agent should I use?

Claude Code and Codex have native loop engineering features. The concepts apply to any agent with filesystem access. See [FAQ.md](FAQ.md).

### What is the Ralph Wiggum loop?

The original technique: `while : ; do cat PROMPT.md | claude ; done`. Created by Geoffrey Huntley in July 2025. See [Module 02](modules/02-what-is-loop-engineering/README.md).

## Illustrations

This repository includes illustrations in the Ian Xiaohei style (小黑怪诞正文配图) to help visualize key concepts. The illustrations use:

- **16:9 horizontal format** with pure white background
- **Black hand-drawn line art** with slight wobble
- **小黑 (Xiaohei)** as the core character: a solid black creature performing key actions
- **Sparse red/orange/blue Chinese annotations** for clarity

![Illustration Style Example](assets/illustrations/readme/01-big-idea-transformation.svg)

For detailed illustration prompts and generation guides, see [ILLUSTRATION-GUIDE.md](assets/illustrations/ILLUSTRATION-GUIDE.md).

*This repo documents a discipline that is approximately two weeks old. It is not an established field with years of best practice. Treat content here as a snapshot, not a final answer. See [HONESTY.md](HONESTY.md).*

*"Loop engineering" is also an unrelated, older term in structural biology (re-engineering flexible loop regions of enzymes like Cas9). That field has nothing to do with this repository.*
